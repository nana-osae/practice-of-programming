The Health management systems App was developed using Typescript programming lanaguage on the react platform. The user Interface was designed using google's Material UI. A backend was no implement in this app instead data is stored in the browser's localstorage through the javascript API. This saves alot of time in setting up backend when we have this function in the browser ready to be utilized. However there is room for further development as the app can easily be extended and developed further with a solid backend service, that will allow for the distribution and connection of users over a real network system.

Since there is no backend API service, the javascript Notification and Navigator API was used as the means of Notification for patients and Healthcare personels. A timing package called "react-timer-hook" was also used to manageo calculationof the time.

In terms of usability, the App was designed with material ui, which offers many beautiful components for designing user interfaces, which makes the app very appealing and easy to use and understand. The react router is also one of the packages used here to make routing and navigating through pages easyy and automatic in situations like registering and logging into the app as a user.

The code was written using VS code, whose very rich libraries for writing cleaning code helps to prevent bugs as much as possible. The app is also written in such as way that a third party can easily understand the code and extend it where necessary. To ensure cleaniness of the code the state management Library "redux-tool-kit" was used in order to avoid passing of variables as props to different components which makes the code a bit messier.

A light security mechanism was impemented as well with react router to prevent unauthorized users from acessing certain pages meant for only the personels. Also input validations while logging in and registering were considered and handles using the react-hook-form and state with redux tool-kit.

Please feel free to expore the app and don't forget to leave any tip or advice while at it.
